Acoustic-Authentication
=======================

The systemâ€™s objective is to provide a method to transfer data over ultra sonic sound waves. Our implementation is using normal range sound waves due to speaker and microphone hardware limitations. 
The system consists of two parts:Transmitter: A java based application that transmits a string password as acoustic beeps.Receiver: An arduino circuit that listens for the beeps sequence, analyze it and checks if the password matches to the saved password.Working example:
